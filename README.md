# MyWeather
A simple app that displays the weather forecast based on the user's current location. This app uses the Open Weather Map API, so please make sure to get your own API key from https://openweathermap.org/ and place it in the `OpenWeatherApiKey` property inside the `Constants` file before you run the app (or any unit tests).

**Disclaimer**
Even though the OpenWeatherApiKey variable is in the constants file, it is not really ideal to have API keys inside the code. I put it there for demo purposes only. If you decide to use this code to create a production app, please move the keys to a more secure location outside the code.
